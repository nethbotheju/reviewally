ReviewAlly reads your pull request diff through the GitHub API and posts a structured review — background, per-file changes, and prioritized recommendations. It runs with your model and your API key: OpenAI, Anthropic, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

## Features

- **Bring your own key:** OpenAI, Anthropic, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint — your model, your billing.
- **Two review modes:** fast diff review, or agent mode that investigates your repo first.
- **On your terms:** trigger by label, slash command, or automatically.
- **Configured from the UI:** swap model, provider, or review mode in repository variables — no commits, no pull requests.
- **Structured reviews:** background, per-file changes, prioritized recommendations.

## Quick start

1. Install the **ReviewAlly App** on your repository or organization: [github.com/apps/reviewally](https://github.com/apps/reviewally).
2. Add one repository secret — `REVIEWALLY_API_KEY` — with your provider API key.
3. Set your provider config as repository variables under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables**:

   | Variable | Example value |
   | --- | --- |
   | `REVIEWALLY_API_TYPE` | `openai` |
   | `REVIEWALLY_MODEL` | `gpt-4o` |
   | `REVIEWALLY_BASE_URL` | *(only for `openai-chat-compatible` providers)* |

   This is the whole config. Model, provider, review mode — change these any time and the next review picks it up. No commit, no PR.

4. Copy the workflow below into `.github/workflows/reviewally.yml` (also in [`examples/workflow.yml`](./examples/workflow.yml)):

```yaml
name: reviewally
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize, labeled]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

concurrency:
  group: reviewally-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.event.issue.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  review:
    if: |
      (github.event_name == 'pull_request' &&
        (github.event.action != 'labeled' || github.event.label.name == 'reviewally'))
      || (github.event_name == 'issue_comment' &&
        startsWith(github.event.comment.body, '/reviewally') &&
        github.event.issue.pull_request != null)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      actions: read    # lets ReviewAlly read REVIEWALLY_* repository variables
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: nethbotheju/reviewally@v1
        with:
          app-token-url: https://api.reviewally.nethbotheju.dev/token
          api-key: ${{ secrets.REVIEWALLY_API_KEY }}
          # Optional: pin a setting here to override its variable for this workflow
          # api-type: openai-chat-compatible        # overrides REVIEWALLY_API_TYPE
          # base-url: https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1 # overrides REVIEWALLY_BASE_URL
          # model: gpt-4o                           # overrides REVIEWALLY_MODEL
          # review-mode: agent                      # overrides REVIEWALLY_REVIEW_MODE
        # Paste this once; from now on change values in Settings, not here.
        env:
          REVIEWALLY_API_TYPE: ${{ vars.REVIEWALLY_API_TYPE }}
          REVIEWALLY_BASE_URL: ${{ vars.REVIEWALLY_BASE_URL }}
          REVIEWALLY_MODEL: ${{ vars.REVIEWALLY_MODEL }}
          REVIEWALLY_REVIEW_MODE: ${{ vars.REVIEWALLY_REVIEW_MODE }}
          REVIEWALLY_AUTO_REVIEW: ${{ vars.REVIEWALLY_AUTO_REVIEW }}
          REVIEWALLY_EXTRA_INSTRUCTIONS: ${{ vars.REVIEWALLY_EXTRA_INSTRUCTIONS }}
          REVIEWALLY_CONTEXT_DOCS: ${{ vars.REVIEWALLY_CONTEXT_DOCS }}
          REVIEWALLY_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS: ${{ vars.REVIEWALLY_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS }}
```

5. Open a pull request, or comment `/reviewally` on one.

The `env:` block is written once and then left alone — it just forwards your repository variables to the action. To pin a setting to the workflow instead, add it to `with:` (e.g. `model: gpt-4o`): an explicit input always overrides the variable. That's the one rule to remember: **the workflow file wins, so don't put config there unless you mean to freeze it.**

## Review modes

### Standard

One focused pass: the PR diff plus repository context (`AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, …) is sent to your model, which returns a structured review. Fast and effective for most changes.

### Agent

For deeper changes, ReviewAlly takes a snapshot of the repository at the PR head and runs the [pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) as the review harness. The model investigates with read-only tools (`read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`) before writing a recommendation, and large repositories automatically fall back to standard mode.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `api-type` | yes¹ | — | `openai` \| `openai-chat-compatible` \| `anthropic` |
| `api-key` | yes | — | LLM API key (store in a secret) |
| `base-url` | only `openai-chat-compatible`¹ | provider default | API base URL override |
| `model` | yes¹ | — | Model identifier |
| `app-token-url` | no | — | ReviewAlly token endpoint; reviews post as `reviewally[bot]` |
| `github-token` | no | `${{ github.token }}` | Token for reading the PR and posting the review |
| `trigger-comment` | no | `/reviewally` | Slash command that triggers a review |
| `trigger-label` | no | `reviewally` | Label that triggers a review |
| `auto-review` | no | `false` | Also review on PR open/reopen/push |
| `review-mode` | no | `standard` | `standard` (single prompt) or `agent` (investigation loop) |
| `max-files` | no | `20` | Max changed files reviewed per run |
| `max-diff-lines` | no | `3000` | Max total added lines reviewed per run |
| `use-default-excludes` | no | `true` | Built-in excludes for lockfiles, minified files, sourcemaps |
| `agent-tarball-max-mb` | no | `200` | Max repo snapshot size before degrading to standard mode |
| `pi-version` | no | `0.82.1` | Agent runtime version |
| `pi-timeout-ms` | no | `600000` | Hard timeout for an agent-mode review |

¹ Or the matching `REVIEWALLY_*` repository variable — see below.

## Repository variables

**Set them once under Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables, then change them any time — no commits, no pull requests.** The workflow forwards each variable to the action with a one-time `env:` block (in the example above), because the workflow token is not allowed to read the variables API. Add one line per variable you use.

Resolution per setting: **workflow input > repository variable > built-in default** — an input written in the workflow always wins, so leave it out of the workflow to let the variable apply.

| Variable | Sets |
| --- | --- |
| `REVIEWALLY_API_TYPE` | LLM API protocol (`openai`, `openai-chat-compatible`, `anthropic`) |
| `REVIEWALLY_BASE_URL` | API base URL (required for `openai-chat-compatible`) |
| `REVIEWALLY_MODEL` | Model identifier |
| `REVIEWALLY_REVIEW_MODE` | `standard` or `agent` |
| `REVIEWALLY_AUTO_REVIEW` | `true` / `false` — review automatically on PR open/reopen/push |
| `REVIEWALLY_EXTRA_INSTRUCTIONS` | Extra guidance appended to the prompt |
| `REVIEWALLY_CONTEXT_DOCS` | Comma/newline-separated doc files for project guidance |
| `REVIEWALLY_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS` | Extra glob excludes (comma/newline separated) |

Switching providers is a pure UI operation: update the API-key secret value, then set `REVIEWALLY_API_TYPE`, `REVIEWALLY_BASE_URL`, and `REVIEWALLY_MODEL`. Unknown `REVIEWALLY_*` variables are ignored, and if variables cannot be read the run falls back to workflow inputs. Each run's summary shows the effective value and where it came from.

## Outputs

Every review covers the issue and background, the proposed solution, a summary of file changes, and prioritized recommendations. Recommendations are prioritized by impact, focusing on security, edge cases, performance, and design decisions.

## Security and privacy

- Your API key is only used to call your provider. It is masked in logs and never sent anywhere else.
- Standard mode never clones your repository. Agent mode downloads a snapshot to the runner's temp directory and deletes it after the review.
- Review tokens are scoped to a single repository, expire in one hour, and only carry review-level permissions (`contents: read`, `pull_requests: write`, `issues: write`).
- Reviews are always advisory — ReviewAlly never requests changes or blocks merges.
